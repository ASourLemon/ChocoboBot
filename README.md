ChocoboBot
==========

A very basic computer program that is capable of identifying Chocobo World in-game events and act in response. 

This program identifies events using screenshots from the game.
After that, it compares the screen image with the frames in folder "images", identifing which event is taking place. 
Finaly, with this, the bot finds the adequate action for the event and acts with it.

Good points:
The program works without problems. It's possible to leave it running when the computer is inactive and wont need supervision.
It fights the mobs as it would be expected from a human. It's very easy to reach maximum level and find alot of items.

Bad points:
The program can't simulate the arrow key pressing as the game requires. As such, the solution is to use the mouse and the windows on screen keyboard.
This isn't very effective. The mouse is used by the program and is not possible to use the computer while running the software.
It's still uncompleted. There are a lot of debug messages on the console and the interface isn't the best.
The coordinates for the on screen keyboard and hard coded in the App class. you need to modify it for your use.
